\section{Squaring preserves evenness}

Here is a theorem about squaring and even numbers. 

\begin{theorem}
    If an integer $m$ is even, then the integer $m^2$ is also even.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $m$ be an even integer. Then, by the definition of even, there exists an integer $n$ such that $m=2n$. Notice that we can write $m^2$ as follows,
$$m^2 = (2n)^2 = 4n^2 = 2(2n^2).$$
This shows that $2$ is a factor of $m^2$ and therefore $m^2$ is even.
\end{proof}
